 Thank you for downloading this project! 

 It is my second attempt in C++ to VB translation.

 It all started when I was trying to translate 
 WINGDI.H. It took me three days to complete about
 1/3 of the translation. I decided to write program
 which will do it automatically.
 First version of the program already in it's first
 run translated about 1/2 of the code in less than
 30 seconds. 
 I improved the translation algorythm and wrote 
 this program completely from null. In the first
 run it translated at already about 2/3 of the 
 header file in less than 10 seconds. I improved 
 some more parts of the algorythm and here it is...

 The core of this project is C_TO_VB.BAS module.
 You can add this module to your own projects or
 user interfaces.

 Module currently is able to automatically:
   - remove unsupported compilier flags
   - convert remarks
   - convert boolean operators (only And, Or)
   - convert hexadecimal values 
   - convert constant definitions 
   - convert type definitions
   - remove casts

 Following features under development:
   - enumeration conversion
   - API declaration conversion

 Module can not and will not be able to convert 
 following code parts, due to the complexity and 
 many variations of C++ code:
   - subs, functions and macros

 Also remember that the C_TO_VB.BAS module can not 
 convert 100% of the source-code. Average efficiency 
 is 80-90%. After using this tool you can convert 
 the remaining code manually.

 Future versions will be more intellegent and I hope
 they will be able to translate 95-99% of the code.

 C++ Header Files
--------------------------------------------------------

 I included some Microsoft "win*" C++ header files (*.H)
 for experimenting with this little module.

 If you have MSVC++ installed, you can find header files
 at MICROSOFT VISUAL STUDIO\VC98\INCLUDE\ folder.

 If you haven't got MSVC++ installed, you still can get
 these header files -- HTTP:\\MSDN.MICROSOFT.COM.

 If you think there is possibilities for this code
 and there would be need to develop it further, 
 please vote -- it doesn't take so long as you think :)
